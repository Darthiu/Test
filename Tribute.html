          <p>
            And now, for the annual Asad's wall of text for your birthday!
            <br> Firstly, Happy birthday again, 21 years old now which is crazy to think about, we met when we were 14, just goes to show fast time flies. 
            But anyway, I hope you have a fantastic day!
            <br> Secondly, What a strong person you are, when I was writing the timeline I was thinking about most of your past experiences that I know of and 
            wow, so much has happened in your life, obviously good experiences but aswell as some really bad ones, but you have held your head high and got past them. 
            Whatever challenge you face, you always find a way through and you never give up. You are always passionate about your goals and you always try your best for things,
            even if they sometimes don't work out, you still give it your all and even after it, you don't give up, you get up and go back at it again, which is a quality 
            I really like about you, it's one of the reasons why I look up to you, why I take inspiration from you.  And not only that, but you are a caring person too, you try
            to give out the best solution and listen to others regardless of their problem which is an universally liked quality and that's why you are so liked by everyone, because
            you care about everyone. You are the one who motivated me the most to continue with these coding campaign and I couldn't be more glad to have you as my friend and such a
            long friend too. Thank you for everything you have done for me, joining my stream or even listening to my yap too. And more importantly <br>
            Thank you for being here. Inshallah, you will get to see many more happiness in your life. Continue being strong, genius, brave and yourself. You are awesome. 
          </p>
          <cite>-- Your best friend, Asad Ullah</cite>
